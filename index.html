                <h2>Excel Record Macro</h2>
                <p>
                    I started my programming journey by clicking on the record macro 
                    button in Microsoft Excel. This button wrote VBA code for me 
                    based on the actions I took inside Excel. I was able to very 
                    quickly see which lines of code did what and vise versa. I created 
                    data processing buttons with just this ability with very little 
                    understanding of how to actually write code.

                <h2>VBA Coding</h2>
                <p>
                    I was eventually forced to learn how to write VBA code because of 
                    the record macro button’s limitations. I needed to learn how to 
                    write loops and “if else” statements. Larger datasets required me 
                    to learn how to optimize my code and learn how to utilize arrays 
                    and dictionaries. I also learned how to create user friendly 
                    interfaces with user-forms.

                <p>
                    I took various programming college classes and one of them was in 
                    the programming language C++. I learned sorting algorithms and 
                    object oriented programming. This furthered my understanding of 
                    best practices and writing more readable code.

                <h2>Python</h2>
                <p>
                    I recently learned the programming language Python. It is by far 
                    the cleanest and easiest to write and understand so far. Slices 
                    and list comprehensions are among the many powerful tools that I 
                    have learned about Python. The utility of the vast libraries 
                    available is also a valuable tool.
